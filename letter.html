        <p>
          <strong>Again I wish you the happiest 22nd birthday Chad!!!!</strong> I’m so proud of the person you are and the life you’re quietly building, 
          the way you move through the world with intention, curiosity, and care. 
          You have this incredible ability to make even the most ordinary days feel meaningful, 
          like they’re worth remembering, worth keeping. I really appreciate the little things you do bb. Being with you feels grounding and exciting at the same time, 
          and I genuinely can’t even imagine a version of my life where you weren’t in it. 
          It feels like I’ve known you forever, like you’ve always been part of my story, even before I had the words for it, like I have always had the feeling that I have been missing my other half and I finally feel whole. 
        </p>
        <p>
          From around 296 nights falling asleep side by side to all the moments 
          in between, the big adventures and the tiny ones, you’ve 
          been my favorite constant. Studying together, staying up too late, building a little 
          world in Stardew, creating things just because we can, and simply existing next to each other 
          has made every day my happiest. This scrapbook is just a small attempt to 
          hold onto pieces of a year that meant everything to me, but it still doesn’t come 
          close to capturing how deeply my love for you is or how much you mean to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watching you graduate filled me with so much pride I didn’t know where to put it. 
          I’ve seen your dedication, your focus, and the way you commit fully to the things 
          you care about, and it inspires me every day. You are so driven to do great things, 
          and I know this is only the beginning. I can’t wait to watch you grow, succeed, and 
          surprise yourself with everything you’re capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love you endlessly, in a way that feels steady and certain and forever. 
          I can’t wait for all the years ahead, for us to grow old together, build a 
          home that feels warm and safe, and fill it with laughter, memories, and a lifetime 
          of shared moments. No matter where life takes us, I know one thing for sure, 
          choosing you will always be my favorite decision. Meeting you was genuinely the best 
          thing that has ever happened to me. 
        </p>
